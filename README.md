# To-Do List App

A simple and responsive to-do list application built with React. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with task data and checkbox states persisted across sessions using `localStorage`. The app ensures clean input by preventing whitespace-only tasks and uses unique IDs for reliable task management.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Enter tasks via an input field and add them by clicking "Add" or pressing Enter.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with a "Delete" button.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Toggle checkboxes to mark tasks as done, with strikethrough styling.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents adding empty or whitespace-only tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS Modules and Tailwind-like classes for a modern UI.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling for the app.
- **uuid**: Generates unique IDs for tasks.
